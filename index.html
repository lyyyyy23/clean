        <b>[Verse 1]</b> <br />
        The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
        When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst <br />
        It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
        You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
        <br /><br />

        [Pre-Chorus] <br />
        Hung my head as I lost the war <br />
        And the sky turned black like a perfect storm <br />
        <br />

        [Chorus] <br />
        The rain came pouring down <br />
        When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe <br />
        And by mornin' <br />
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean <br />
        <br />

        [Verse 2] <br />
        There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
        When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room<br />
        So I punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah<br />
        Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you<br /><br />

        [Pre-Chorus]<br />
        The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud<br />
        But no one heard a thing<br />

        [Chorus]<br />
        The rain came pouring down <br />
        When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe<br />
        And by mornin'<br />
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean<br /><br />

        [Post-Chorus] <br />
        I think I am finally clean<br />
        Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah <br />
        Said, I think I am finally clean<br />
        Ah-ah-ah-ah <br /><br />

        [Bridge]<br />
        Ten months sober, I must admit <br />
        Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it<br />
        Ten months older, I won't give in <br />
        Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it <br />
        The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
        When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst (Oh)
        <br /><br />

        [Chorus]<br />
        The rain came pouring down<br />
        When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe<br />
        And by mornin' <br />
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean<br />
        The rain came pouring down<br />
        When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe <br />
        And by mornin'<br />
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean<br /><br />

        [Outro]<br />
        Finally clean<br />
        Think I'm finally clean<br />
        Ah-ah, ah-ah <br />
        Think I'm finally clean<br />
