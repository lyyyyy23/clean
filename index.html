    <p>
        [Verse 1] <br>
        The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah <br>
        When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst <br>
        It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah <br>
        You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore <br><br>

        [Pre-Chorus] <br>
        Hung my head as I lost the war <br>
        And the sky turned black like a perfect storm <br> <br>

        [Chorus] <br>
        The rain came pouring down <br>
        When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe <br>
        And by mornin' <br>
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean <br> <br>

        [Verse 2] <br>
        There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah <br>
        When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room<br>
        So I punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah<br> 
        Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you<br><br>

        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud<br>
        But no one heard a thing<br>
       
        [Chorus]<br>
        The rain came pouring down <br>
        When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe<br>
        And by mornin'<br>
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean<br><br>

        [Post-Chorus] <br>
        I think I am finally clean<br>
        Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah <br>
        Said, I think I am finally clean<br>
        Ah-ah-ah-ah <br><br>

        [Bridge]<br>
        Ten months sober, I must admit <br>
        Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it<br>
        Ten months older, I won't give in <br>
        Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it <br>
        The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah <br>
        When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst (Oh) <br><br>

        [Chorus]<br>
        The rain came pouring down<br>
        When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe<br>
        And by mornin' <br>
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean<br>
        The rain came pouring down<br>
        When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe <br>
        And by mornin'<br>
        Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean<br><br>

        [Outro]<br>
        Finally clean<br>
        Think I'm finally clean<br>
        Ah-ah, ah-ah <br>
        Think I'm finally clean<br>
